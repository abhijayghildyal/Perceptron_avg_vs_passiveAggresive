=============== Perceptron ===============


Preparing data.....



=============== Standard Perceptron and Passive Aggressive Perceptron ===============


Training and Testing on Standard Perceptron and Passive Aggressive Perceptron.....


Plotting for Standard and PA perceptron


Varying data in increments of 5000 and training



=============== Average Perceptron ===============
  
  
Training and Testing on Naive Average Perceptron vs Smart Average Perceptron.....  
  
--- Naive avg perceptron took: 0.3811531066894531 seconds ---  
--- Smart avg perceptron took: 0.3231511116027832 seconds ---  
Ans 13 Done.....
